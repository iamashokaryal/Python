# In Python, everything is an object.

number = 5

# we have been mentioning that this code stores 5 in variable number, Technically, it's wrong

# number doesnot store 5, it is refering to 5.

# number ----> 5 

# if we create another variable number1 and assign number to it,
# both number and number1 will refer to the same object.

number1 = number

# number -----> 5 <------- nunber1
