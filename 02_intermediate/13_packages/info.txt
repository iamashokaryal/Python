Creating the Game Package
To create this package,

We will first create a directory named game.
Inside this folder, we will create a file named __init__.py. This is a special file that tells Python that this directory is a Python package.
Let's keep this __init__.py empty for now.
Inside the game package, we will create the characters package. Hence, we will create a directory named characters inside the game directory.
To tell the game directory is also a package, we will create the __init__.py file inside it.
Inside the game, we will create two modules player.py and boss.py.
Outside of the game directory, we will create a file named main.py, from where we will access our package components.
