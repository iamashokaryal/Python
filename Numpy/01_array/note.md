# Arrange function 
-We have used the Python range() function while iterating over a range of numbers.

-NumPy has a similar function np.arange() which can do the same thing as the range function.

-Let's see the syntax of np.arange() = 
np.arange(start, stop, step)
Here,

1.start (optional): The start value of the sequence. If not provided, the default is 0.

2.stop: The end value of the sequence. This value is excluded from the array.

3.step (optional): The step between values. If not provided, the default is 1.
