Hereâ€™s an intermediate-level Python problem for you:

Problem: Word Frequency Counter
Write a Python function that takes a string of text as input and returns a dictionary where the keys are the unique words in the string, and the values are the number of times each word appears.

Requirements:
Ignore case (i.e., "Python" and "python" should be considered the same word).
Punctuation should be removed from the words (e.g., "hello," and "hello" should be considered the same word).
The function should return the words sorted alphabetically in the dictionary.
Example:
python
Copy code
text = "Python is great! Python is fun. Fun is good."
The output should be:

python
Copy code
{'fun': 2, 'good': 1, 'is': 3, 'python': 2, 'great': 1}
You can assume the input will always be a string. Let me know when you're ready with your solution!
